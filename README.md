## Deployment
After preparing the site for deployment, the next step was to host it on GitHub pages. I followed these steps to deploy:

- Go to the Settings tab of the Github Repository.
- Under the code and automation section, I navigate to the Pages section.
- In Github Pages, I select the main branch to deploy the page.
- After selecting the main branch, the page will refresh and display a link to confirm the successful deployment.
